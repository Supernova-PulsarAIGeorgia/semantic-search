# semantic-search

## About Project

This project implements a semantic search for social media posts. Instead of searching for literal matches, it considers the contextual meaning of the words in query text and data. The project is divided into conceptual code and an actual search engine.

### text_similarity
The folder contains experimentation on computing the similarity of two texts and finding similar texts in a given corpus.

### image_similarity
Explores different ways of comparing two images and searching for similar pictures in the sample dataset.

### app
Implements actual search engine.
