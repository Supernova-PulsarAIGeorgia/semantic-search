# semantic-search

## About Project
---

This project implements a semantic search for text and images. Instead of searching for literal matches, it considers the contextual meaning of the words in query text and data. For Images, search works not only with cropped or distorted images but also with similar scenes in different lighting, the same person from different angles, etc.

## Usage
---

Search is implemented as REST API. It contains Georgian proverbs and a sample image dataset for searching. Users can add new sentences, and new images, search for similar images to the one already in storage by its id, or search for a keyword in all texts. You can run the server by installing all of the requirements described in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Supernova-PulsarAIGeorgia/semantic-search/blob/main/requirements.txt) and run the FastAPI server with:
```sh
uvicorn app.main:app
```
Alternatively, you can run the application in docker by running the following commands in the project root:
```sh
docker build . -t semantic-search
docker run -p 8080:8080 semantic-search
```

## API
---
Please refer to [API Documentation](https://github.com/Supernova-PulsarAIGeorgia/semantic-search/blob/main/api_docs.md).

## Structure
---
The project is divided into conceptual code and an actual search engine.

### Text Similarity
[Text Similarity.ipynb](https://github.com/Supernova-PulsarAIGeorgia/semantic-search/blob/main/Text%20Similarity.ipynb) contains experimentation on computing the similarity of two texts and finding similar texts in a given corpus.

### Image Similarity
[Image Similarity.ipynb](https://github.com/Supernova-PulsarAIGeorgia/semantic-search/blob/main/Image%20Similarity.ipynb) explores different ways of comparing two images and searching for similar pictures in the sample dataset.

### App
Implements actual search engine. Currently, this part is implemented as REST API.

[main](https://github.com/Supernova-PulsarAIGeorgia/semantic-search/blob/main/app/main.py) implements the server and searching.

[comparator](https://github.com/Supernova-PulsarAIGeorgia/semantic-search/blob/main/app/comparator.py) contains comparator classes for both texts and images.

[storage](https://github.com/Supernova-PulsarAIGeorgia/semantic-search/blob/main/app/storage.py) contains a class for storing texts and images. Other storage or database integrations can be implemented here.
